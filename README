A high-level and easy to use graphics library with several backends,
currently including Cairo(+Gtk UI), Gloss and TikZ.

Craftwerk is a high-level 2D vector graphics library for output of
TikZ pictures that can be typeset using (pdf)LaTeX. The library tries
to encapsulate the graphics backend such that figures can also be
rendered with a Cairo backend and quickly displayed in a Gtk
window. The aim is to support TikZ and Cairo seamlessly as possible,
meaning that graphics produced with either backend should look as
similar as possible. Other backends like Gloss and Haha do not claim
to produce visually similar pictures to TikZ or Cairo or even to
support all features. Nonetheless, any Craftwerk 'Figure' can be
rendered with every backend. Please refer to the documentation page of
the specific backend driver for a description of the supported
features (unsupported features might be ignored).

Graphics are generated using a simple data type and can be rendered
with one of the available backends.
